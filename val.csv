4986,gatt warns u s on federal budget protectionism the united states emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the general agreeement on tariffs and trade gatt said by stressing its record trade deficit of billion dlrs last year the u s was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report the fundamental problem the size of the u s federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said gatt also predicted world trade would grow by only pct in a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit raising u s trade barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit it would however increase inflation and reduce world trade it said the basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain the report said gatt economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in japan and some west european nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher u s inflation concerns over third world debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts of japan west germany and the u s had increased in the most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said gatt warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the u s inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade but the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the united states despite the dollar s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive it suggested that resources idle in the u s both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad world trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in about half of the rate of the previous year trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade gatt said developing countries exports declined significantly while their imports increased moderately although full statistics are not available yet gatt said the combined export earnings of major indebted nations were sharply lower and only five of them chile colombia philippines south korea and thailand had higher exports reuter,trade

2426,european beet plantings seen little changed european sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year despite recent firmness in world prices analysts and industry sources said a reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while so far european community ec growers plan unchanged to lower areas increases are expected in some eastern european nations trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant european beet plantings made last week by west german sugar statistician f o licht areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this in recent years good autumn weather has given yields a late boost making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons changes in ec areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so called c sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market this is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the ec a and b quotas which receive full and partial price support respectively some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the ec commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into ec intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high ec internal and low world market prices however with the ec budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic a and b quotas they added in france the largest producer of ec quota and non quota sugar the sugar market intervention board firs said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year s hectares nine pct below the previous year the basic trend is towards stability a firs spokesman said unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars

highest in the ec apart from the netherlands but below the previous year and a five year average in west germany recent price rises have not altered plans since planting decisions were taken a few months ago industry sources said the farm ministry said a december survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in when yields were above average licht last week estimated west german plantings at a reduced hectares against last year british sugar plc the monopoly beet processor has signed up u k farmers to grow mln tonnes of beet this should yield about mln tonnes of whites last year s crop equalled the second highest ever at mln tonnes british sugar has a and b quotas totalling mln tonnes of whites and its c output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease resistant seed types recent price rises have not altered polish plans wincenty nowicki a deputy director of cukropol the amalgamated sugar industry

before prices began to rise put plantings this year at hectares against in nowicki said last year production was mln tonnes world prices have less impact in italy than in france or germany as it is

around tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of c sugar last year the netherlands produced a record mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined a and b quota of only tonnes the world price of sugar
